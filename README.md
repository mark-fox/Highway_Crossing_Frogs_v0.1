# Highway_Crossing_Frogs_v0.1

  This is my first web app project that involves drawing interactive objects to a Canvas. It is an attempt to be a variation of the classic game, Frogger. In this game, the player navigates a vehicle down a highway while attempting to avoid hitting any giant, mutated frogs.

  The game is not complete at the moment, but does involve some of the mechanics such as creating objects, collision detection, and redrawing the Canvas.
